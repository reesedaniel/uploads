            <li>White</li>
            <li>Yellow</li>
            <li>Purple</li>
            <li>Fingerling</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>What does it taste like?</h4>
        <p>Potatoes taste like heaven in your mouth: slightly sweet, fluffy on the inside and cruchy on the outside! Potatoes go with just about any other food (they even go well with other potatoes!). Dip them in ketchup! Dip them in mustard! Don't dip them at all! The fact of the matter is that potatoes are the greatest food on earth!</p>
